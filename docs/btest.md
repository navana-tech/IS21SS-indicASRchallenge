<p style="font-size:16.5px;">If you are a registered participant, you can start making submissions for blind test set.</p>

<p style="font-size:16.5px;">General guidelines for blind test hypotheses submission are:</p>

<p style="font-size:16.5px;">1. One (and only one) representative team member from every team is required to fill the following google form at least 12 hours before starting to make submissions for the challenge:<a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWFu3xbuKAp_0MTslVp0G-Pik_MPsGSjVs61EbNA-dGa4NYA/viewform?usp=sf_link"> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWFu3xbuKAp_0MTslVp0G-Pik_MPsGSjVs61EbNA-dGa4NYA/viewform?usp=sf_link</a> </p>

<p style="font-size:16.5px;">2. A team name is mandatory for every team, which will be used as a unique identifier for evaluation and in the leaderboard.</p>

<p style="font-size:16.5px;">3. We strongly discourage participants registering with multiple email addresses and participating from multiple teams, and request participants to be fair, honest and faithful to the challenge and its rules. Any kind of malpractice by any participant/team will lead to the disqualification of the team(s) involved.</p>
