    <p><strong>Title: </strong>Speech Processing: Handcrafted features to Deep Representations</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advent of deep learning to the speech processing field for about a decade, a lot of attempts have been made towards learning the representations from spectrographic representation of speech. These representations are based on nonlinear processing and
seem to capture more information from speech. The other mostly practised approach is handcrafted features extracted using signal processing and linked to speech production and/or perception. These approaches are mostly based on linear processing and are mathematically tractable.  This talk will take through the journey of speech processing from earliest explorations of handcrafted features to the latest deep representations. </p>

    <p><strong>Title: </strong>Recent advances in transfer learning and multilingual methods for streaming end-to-end ASR systems</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transfer learning (TL) and multilingual models often improve the performance of low resource langauges, by leveraging data from high resource langauges. Multilingual models also simplify the training and deployment strategy, as a single model is used for multiple languages. This talk will provide an overview of recent advances in TL and multilingual methods for streaming end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems.  Though there is considerable progress, most of the multilingual methods assume the availability of the input language. Hence, it is still challenging to provide a truly multilingual experience, where users can interact with voice assistants in any language, interchangeably, without explicitly setting the language of the conversation. While highlighting the improvements made, we will also discuss the practical challenges and potential research directions in building a truly multilingual experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Overview of Speech Recognition Technology in Conversational Agents</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> From the early days of modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) research in the 1990s, one of the driving visions of the field has been a computer-based assistant that could accomplish tasks for the user, simply by being spoken to. Today, we are close to achieving that vision, with a whole array of speech-enabled AI agents eager to help users. Amazon’s Alexa pioneered the AI assistant concept for smart speaker devices enabled by far-field ASR. It currently supports billions of customer interactions per week, on over 100 million devices across multiple languages. This talk will give an overview of the interplay between underlying speech technologies, including wakeword detection, endpointing, speaker identification, and speech recognition that enable Alexa. We highlight successes and challenges in developing large-scale ASR, and dive into the unique data aspects of large-scale deployments like Alexa, where a continuous stream of unlabeled data enables successful applications of semi-supervised learning. Finally, we highlight problems that remain to be solved before the promise of a fully natural, conversational assistant is fully realized.</p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Spoken Language Understanding for the Indic Region.</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we will touch upon some of the key challenges in building Spoken Language Understanding systems for the Indic region. We begin with an insight on the usage of code-mixed multi-lingual utterances where many Indic languages (beyond Hindi) are freely used. We show how such Indic language usage gets represented in Latin script in a transliterated form and current state of the art multi-lingual language models (such as XLM-R, mBERT) surprisingly do not build common representations of transliterated text and that in the original language. We then introduce research in Continual Language Learning as an emerging area to bridge this gap. The Indic region also sees wide variety of spoken language variations including grammatical errors and ambiguous utterances leading to noise in data. We present recent progress in the area of Robust Machine Learning that aims to build learning algorithms that are resilient to noise in data. </p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> What next after ASR in Indian Languages? We speak in order to be understood!</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The MUCS 2021 challenge has focused on building multilingual and code-switching ASR systems for Indian languages in low resource settings. Within this challenge, teams have successfully tackled important problems and have demonstrated significant improvements on various languages. Where do these gains lead us next? If we speak in order to be understood, we advocate that the next frontier in this space is spoken language understanding (SLU). In this talk we will review recent work in end-to-end spoken language understanding, where the speech input is directly processed into intent without going through an intermediate text transcript. The lessons learnt in building ASR systems in low resource settings are extremely useful for this task too, as very often there is very limited SLU training data. We will share insights on training E2E SLU systems and the challenges ahead and how they can be applied for Indic languages.</p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Introduction of ESPnet, End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An end-to-end neural approach has become a popular alternative to conventional modular approaches in various speech applications including speech recognition and synthesis.
    One of the benefits of this end-to-end neural framework is that we can use a unified framework for different speech processing problems based on sequence-to-sequence modeling. This tutorial aims to introduce various end-to-end speech processing applications by focusing on the above unified framework within an open source toolkit named ESPnet (End-to-end speech processing toolkit https://github.com/espnet/espnet). We will explain the recent advance of ESPnet, including conformer: convolution-augmented transformer, and show an example of making an ESPnet recipe to build a state-of-the-art ASR system. </p>
